# Halloween Challenge
As a committee member of the Developer's Society (2020 - 2021) I decided to run a mini Halloween Challenge for all of our members. Participants had to create a program that was considered to be **cursed** in the eyes of other Developers. 

This meant getting creative with programming techniques to generate the most incoherent, inefficient snippets of code.

My first submission makes use of C++'s lack of restrictions on code formatting while also making the most of comparison operators and nested if loops ... my second submission in Python over complicates the classic "Hello World!" program.
